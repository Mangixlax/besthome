          "BestHome Construction chooses only the best areas of Alanya with excellent infrastructure for its projects. The plots on which the projects are being built are of great value. Around them, as a rule, everything has been built up for a long time. Accordingly, the infrastructure in such areas is very active. Here you will find many parks, squares and green areas for a comfortable family vacation.",
          "When implementing new projects, our company invariably gives preference to such areas as the center of Alanya (including the Damlatash area) and Oba. In Oba, due to the limitation in the height of projects according to the city plan, the company's margins are often lower, but that is why all projects are used as highly liquid ones. This area has been considered European for about 15 years. Cozy complexes with 5-storey blocks and swimming pools conquered Europeans with their laconic style and comfort.",
          "And finally, the most popular area among our clients is Damlatas. It is located in the very center of Alanya and very close to the main city. It has everything you need for a calm and comfortable life: landscaped beaches marked with the Blue Flag, schools, hospitals, cafes, restaurants, tennis courts and chic walking areas. The special charm of Damlatas is given by the fact that the building height is limited to five floors here, and the road along the embankment is one-way. Despite the large number of tourists, it is always comfortable and calm here. The cost of housing in this area is quite high, which guarantees you a profitable investment in real estate and the possibility of further renting out an apartment or selling it at a more attractive price."

          "In the competitive world that is the Alanya real estate industry, it is important always to stay ahead of the competition – one way to do this is by offering something totally unique in terms of design, both externally and internally.",
          "As an example, all Best Home projects are low-rise and the external facade will incorporate a mix of materials and finishes that will set it apart from other developments in the area – additionally, the external social areas will comprise lush landscaping, decorative walling and a tiled sun terrace surrounding the pool.",
          "For the interior of each property, we have a highly skilled and specialised interior design team that enable us to constantly deliver modern living spaces of the very highest quality – this quality is evident throughout, not just in the fittings and fixtures but also in the design detail. For example, the kitchens have an ample expanse of bench space and ample upper and lower storage, both critical elements in modern apartment living.",
          "In addition to the interior design being streamlined and aesthetically pleasing, all fittings and fixtures are long lasting and hard wearing.",
          "By paying close attention to these design details, we believe our projects are a cut above the rest and one of the the primary reasons why our projects are so successful – as an example, some 75% of all units (within any project) are sold well before project completion.",
          "Additionally, this close attention to detail ‘adds value’ to all units within a specific project and will go some way to ensuring its status as an investment asset, both at the time of purchase as well as at the time (if appropriate) of reselling.",
          "These ‘value added’ details are also important for those clients that are ‘buying to rent’ – with the rental market in Alanya continuing to grow, highly specified apartments (within a good location) are at the top of every renter’s wish list!"

They wanted to create a company with Turkish traditions and a European face. The new fast-growing real estate market was perfectly suited for this purpose, although there was already competition then. But the founders of the company believed that their brainchild would be able to take a leading position and, as later life showed, they were not mistaken in their forecasts.",
          "Based on the experience of working in the leading real estate agency in Alanya, they understood that there was no such product on the market that they would like to offer to demanding European clients, as well as quality after-sales service. Then decisions were made that determined the way for the further development of the company. The first is to build houses of European quality level that meet the expectations and wishes of clients, the second is to keep these promises, to create trusting relationships with clients, the third is to be innovators and legislators in the real estate market of Alanya, and the fourth is to introduce as many clients around the world as possible to the beautiful city. Alanya and the unrivaled Turkish culture, add value to the region."
