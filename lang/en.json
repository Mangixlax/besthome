In Oba, due to the limitation in the height of projects according to the city plan, the company's margins are often lower, but that is why all projects are used as highly liquid ones. This area has been considered European for about 15 years. Cozy complexes with 5-storey blocks and swimming pools conquered Europeans with their laconic style and comfort.",

The special charm of Damlatas is given by the fact that the building height is limited to five floors here, and the road along the embankment is one-way. Despite the large number of tourists, it is always comfortable and calm here. The cost of housing in this area is quite high, which guarantees you a profitable investment in real estate and the possibility of further renting out an apartment or selling it at a more attractive price."

The new fast-growing real estate market was perfectly suited for this purpose, although there was already competition then. But the founders of the company believed that their brainchild would be able to take a leading position and, as later life showed, they were not mistaken in their forecasts.",

Then decisions were made that determined the way for the further development of the company. The first is to build houses of European quality level that meet the expectations and wishes of clients, the second is to keep these promises, to create trusting relationships with clients, the third is to be innovators and legislators in the real estate market of Alanya, and the fourth is to introduce as many clients around the world as possible to the beautiful city. Alanya and the unrivaled Turkish culture, add value to the region."
