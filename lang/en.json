          "The history of BestHome Construction began in 2004 in Alanya, when two young people decided to start their own business in Turkey, based on long-term partnerships, European understanding of service and respect for customers. They wanted to create a company with Turkish traditions and a European face. The new fast-growing real estate market was perfectly suited for this purpose, although there was already competition then. But the founders of the company believed that their brainchild would be able to take a leading position and, as later life showed, they were not mistaken in their forecasts.",
          "Based on the experience of working in the leading real estate agency in Alanya, they understood that there was no such product on the market that they would like to offer to demanding European clients, as well as quality after-sales service. Then decisions were made that determined the way for the further development of the company. The first is to build houses of European quality level that meet the expectations and wishes of clients, the second is to keep these promises, to create trusting relationships with clients, the third is to be innovators and legislators in the real estate market of Alanya, and the fourth is to introduce as many clients around the world as possible to the beautiful city. Alanya and the unrivaled Turkish culture, add value to the region."
